/**
 * The line chart, and the area chart that is a line with the space beneath it
 * filled.
 *
 * Almost every convention here is the opposite of the bar chart's, which is
 * worth stating plainly because the temptation is to share more than is
 * correct:
 *
 * - **Zero is not forced into the domain.** A bar encodes magnitude by length
 *   from a baseline, so cropping the axis lies about proportions. A line
 *   encodes change by slope, and cropping to the data is what makes the shape
 *   readable - a temperature chart starting at zero is mostly empty space.
 *   An *area* chart does force zero, because the filled region is measured from
 *   the baseline and is meaningless without it.
 *
 * - **A hole breaks the line.** In a stack a missing series closes up; in a
 *   line, joining across a gap invents a measurement that was never taken. The
 *   line stops and restarts.
 *
 * - **Points sit at band centers** rather than filling a band, since a line
 *   marks an instant rather than covering an interval.
