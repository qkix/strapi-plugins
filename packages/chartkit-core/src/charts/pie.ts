/**
 * The pie chart, and the donut that is a pie with its middle removed.

 * This is the first chart here with no axes, no baseline and no categories
 * along a scale - so it shares almost nothing with the others except the title,
 * the legend and the accessible description. Trying to route it through the
 * cartesian pipeline would mean threading "except for pie" through every step
 * of it.
 *
 * The other difference is what the colors mean. In a bar or line chart a color
 * is a *series*; here there is only one series and a color is a *category*, so
 * the legend names the slices.
