 * The legend.
 *
 * Only worth drawing when there is more than one series: with one, the title
 * already says what the bars are, and a legend restating it is furniture.
 *
 * The interesting part is wrapping. Series names are author-written and can be
 * any length, so a single row of entries runs off the side of the viewBox at
 * the worst possible moment - the chart with eight series, which is exactly the
 * one that needs its legend. So entries are packed into rows here, and the
 * height that falls out is fed back into the layout before the plot is sized.
