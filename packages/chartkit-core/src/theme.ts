 * the server - while the reader's light or dark preference is known in the
 * browser, usually as a class on `<html>` flipped by a toggle. Serving baked
 * colors to that leaves you rendering two copies, or falling back to
 * `prefers-color-scheme` and ignoring the toggle.
 *
 * So every color here is a `var()` with a fallback. The chart inherits the
 * page's theme by doing nothing at all, and a site that wants its own palette
 * sets the custom properties in its own stylesheet - no rebuild, no rerender.
