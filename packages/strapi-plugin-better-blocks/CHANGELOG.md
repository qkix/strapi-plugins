## 0.21.0

### Minor Changes

- [#82](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/82) [`9c2a1b4`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/9c2a1b4431b000e5592beb89a946f053a58d1064) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - feat: merge & split table cells (closes [#79](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/79))

  Cells can now be merged into a rectangle and split back apart, completing the
  table work started in [#36](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/36).

  **Merging.** Select a range of cells - drag across them, or click one and
  Shift+click another - and use **Merge cells** in the table's contextual toolbar.
  The two endpoints act as opposite corners, so selecting from `r2c1` to `r3c2`
  merges a 2×2 block rather than everything between them in document order. If the
  picked rectangle would slice through an existing merged cell, it grows until it
  contains that cell whole, so the result always tiles the grid. Text from the
  absorbed cells is appended to the anchor rather than discarded.

  **Splitting.** **Split cell** resets the cell to 1×1 and refills every slot it
  vacates with an empty cell. Content stays where it was.

  **Header cells stay in the header.** A merge can't cross the header/body divide,
  because HTML doesn't let a `rowSpan` span `<thead>` into `<tbody>` - a browser
  would clamp it and render something other than what the editor showed, and
  `scope="col"` on a cell sitting in body rows labels nothing. The button explains
  itself in that state rather than just greying out. Merging _within_ the header -
  one heading across two columns - is unaffected.

  **The grid model underneath.** Once cells can span, a cell's index within its row
  is no longer its visual column: a row of three cells can cover four columns, and
  a `rowSpan` cell occupies a slot in the row below without having a node there.
  Every structural operation was rewritten against a proper grid model:
  - Inserting a column **widens** a cell that straddles the boundary instead of
    giving it a neighbour, and places new cells at the child index that lands them
    in the right grid column.
  - Deleting a column **shrinks** spanning cells rather than deleting them.
  - Inserting a row **stretches** cells whose `rowSpan` crosses the boundary, and
    the new row only gets cells for the columns those stretched cells don't cover.
  - Deleting a row **re-homes** cells that start in it but continue below, one row
    shorter, so the merge survives.

  Without this, the previous index-based operations would have silently corrupted
  any table containing a merge.

  **JSON shape.** `colSpan` / `rowSpan` on `table-cell` and `table-header-cell`,
  **absent meaning 1** - the same convention as `align`, so unmerged cells store
  neither key and existing tables need no migration. The full table contract is now
  documented in the README for renderer authors. A normalizer repairs spans that
  can't be rendered as written - ones reaching past the table's bounds and ones
  crossing the header/body divide - and refills any slot left uncovered, so
  hand-edited or imported JSON is squared off rather than left ragged.

  Renderers need `colSpan` / `rowSpan` support to match - tracked in
  k11k-labs/better-blocks-react-renderer#50 and
  k11k-labs/better-blocks-astro-renderer#41.

## 0.20.0

### Minor Changes

- [#80](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/80) [`dd9c66f`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/dd9c66f58c31b6c2ac54adf950593b8af2a65b14) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - feat: editor UX overhaul - toolbar grouping, visual table controls, floating selection menu (closes [#36](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/36))

  **Toolbar re-organization.** Controls are now grouped by what they do - history,
  block type, type/colour, marks, paragraph formatting, insertion - and each group
  wraps as a whole instead of splitting across rows. The 1px separators are gone;
  spacing carries the grouping, which survives wrapping at any editor width.
  Blockquote is a direct toggle next to the lists rather than an entry buried in
  the block-type dropdown.

  **Block dropdown.** Each option renders at its own type scale, so the difference
  between H2 and H4 is visible before you pick one, and every option shows its
  keyboard shortcut. Those shortcuts are new and actually work:
  `Cmd/Ctrl+Alt+1..6` for headings, `+0` for paragraph, `+Q` for quote. The
  trigger label is now derived from the document on every render, so it stays in
  sync with conversions that don't move the caret.

  **Fullscreen** moved from the bottom-right corner of the editor body to the
  right edge of the toolbar, where maximize controls are normally found, and the
  same button collapses again while expanded.

  **Table overhaul.**
  - Inserting a table opens a 10×10 hover grid with a live "4 × 6" readout and a
    custom-size fallback, instead of dropping a fixed 3×3.
  - A contextual toolbar floats above the table whenever the caret is inside it,
    with **directional** operations - insert row above/below, insert column
    left/right, delete row/column - all anchored on the focused cell rather than
    appending at the end. It also carries cell alignment, a header-row toggle and
    delete-table.
  - Cell alignment is stored as `align` on `table-cell` / `table-header-cell`.
    Left is stored as _absent_, so existing tables need no migration.
  - Header cells render as `<th scope="col">` for screen readers, and the header
    row can be toggled on or off. Deleting the header row promotes its successor
    rather than silently leaving the table header-less.
  - Borders went from a 1px hairline to 2px against a mid-grey, and the row and
    column holding the caret are tinted for orientation in large tables.
  - Wide tables scroll horizontally instead of overflowing the editor.
  - Cells keep full inline rich-text parity (marks, links, colours, inline math) -
    the structure guard only blocks operations that would break the table's shape.

  **Floating selection toolbar.** Selecting text pops a mini toolbar above it with
  bold, italic, underline, strikethrough, inline code, link, colour and clear
  formatting - no trip to the main toolbar. It hides inside code and void media
  blocks, where marks don't apply.

  Renderers need to follow up on the table changes: see
  k11k-labs/better-blocks-react-renderer#50 and
  k11k-labs/better-blocks-astro-renderer#41. Merge/split cells is tracked
  separately in [#79](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/79) - it needs a cell-range selection model and a span-aware grid,
  which the rest of this work deliberately doesn't assume.

## 0.19.0

### Minor Changes

- [#77](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/77) [`6e4c106`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/6e4c106e56d02007c29c253ce9cb26bf7f56d6de) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - feat: generic Embed block and provider-aware Video block (closes [#44](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/44))

  **Embed block** - insert any third-party embed from the `+` Insert menu, the
  `/embed` slash command, or the toolbar's media button. Two modes: **URL**
  (YouTube, Vimeo, Loom, Wistia, Dailymotion and api.video are converted to an
  iframe automatically) and **Embed code** (paste any platform's `<iframe>`).
  Pasted markup is never stored verbatim - the iframe is rebuilt from an attribute
  allowlist over an https-only `src`, so `<script>`, event handlers, inline styles
  and unknown attributes cannot reach your frontend, and the `allow` attribute is
  filtered to a safe permission set. Adds live in-editor preview, aspect ratio
  (16:9 / 21:9 / 4:3 / 1:1 / custom), alignment, caption and an accessible title.

  **Video block** - source a video from the Media Library, a direct URL, or a
  hosting provider. Mux, api.video and Cloudinary URLs are detected automatically,
  and a bare Mux playback ID fills in the stream URL and poster frame. When
  `strapi-plugin-mux-video-uploader` is installed and configured, a **Mux** button
  lists and searches your Mux assets inline with thumbnails (assets with a signed
  playback policy are not selectable, since they need a per-request JWT that a
  stored token could not satisfy). Supports poster image, title, caption, WebVTT
  captions/transcript, alignment, aspect ratio and player settings.

  The YouTube/Vimeo-only `media-embed` block is **deprecated**: nothing inserts it
  any more and the toolbar media button now creates an `embed` node instead, but
  existing `media-embed` content still renders, and renderers should keep handling
  it.

  Both blocks' JSON shapes are documented in the README for frontend renderers,
  along with the `frame-src` / `img-src` / `media-src` CSP hosts they need.

### Minor Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/75) [`2bcbe8b`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/2bcbe8bb5f39a676ee634c9de5ff84dbdb0b17cf) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Social embeds can now show the real post inside the editor. Each card gets a
  **Show live post** toggle that swaps in the platform's script-free iframe embed
  (X, Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, LinkedIn, Pinterest) - no widget JavaScript
  runs in the admin, so the `script-src 'self'` CSP is untouched.

  Third-party frames load only after that click, never on page load, and the
  choice isn't persisted in the content. Add the platform hosts you use to
  `frame-src` in `config/middlewares.ts` (see the README) - without them the card
  still works, the frame just renders empty.

### Patch Changes

- [#75](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/75) [`2bcbe8b`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/2bcbe8bb5f39a676ee634c9de5ff84dbdb0b17cf) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Fix social embeds that rely on a pasted embed code, and stop TikTok/Pinterest
  posts from degrading to a bare link on the frontend.
  - **Embed code alone is now enough** - Save is enabled when either a post URL or
    an embed code is present, so platforms without a tokenless oEmbed (Instagram,
    Facebook) can be embedded by pasting their snippet. Pasting a snippet also
    recovers the permalink from it (`data-instgrm-permalink`, `cite`, `href`) and
    auto-detects the platform.
  - **Widget scripts are stripped** from both fetched oEmbed markup and pasted
    embed codes. A `<script>` injected via `innerHTML` never executes, and its
    inert tag made renderers believe the platform widget was already loaded - the
    cause of TikTok posts rendering as a raw blockquote of links.
  - **Failed oEmbed lookups now surface an error** instead of silently storing an
    empty payload. Pinterest answers HTTP 200 with `{"error": …}` for unresolvable
    pins, which previously saved an embed with no markup that rendered as a
    "View on Pinterest" fallback card.
  - **`pin.it` short links are resolved** to their canonical `/pin/<id>/` URL
    before the Pinterest oEmbed request, which rejects short links.
  - **LinkedIn embeds keep their URN type.** Every id was rewritten to
    `urn:li:share:<id>`, which LinkedIn 404s for the activity ids that appear in
    share URLs, so no LinkedIn post ever loaded. The type from the URL
    (`activity` / `ugcPost` / `share`) is now preserved.

### Patch Changes

- [#72](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/72) [`59d2da7`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/59d2da704d257ba4c449fb0065d721b9000ca070) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - fix: typing in the audio editor no longer deletes the audio block

  The audio editor was a hand-rolled overlay rendered inline inside the Slate
  `Editable` tree, so every keystroke in its Title/Caption inputs also bubbled to
  the editor's key handlers - which acted on the selected void node and removed
  the block, taking the popup with it. The editor now uses the Strapi
  `Modal` primitive (portalled out of the editable, like the Button and Social
  embed editors), so form input stays in the form.

  Fixes [#70](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/70).

### Minor Changes

- [#68](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/68) [`3a0bb2b`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/3a0bb2b32b998d41dc754d027b6b8fb3e419f758) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - feat: audio block with Media Library integration and a customizable HTML5 player

  Adds a new **Audio** block that lets authors embed audio directly inside the
  Blocks field. Pick a file from the Strapi Media Library (upload included) or
  paste a direct URL, then set a title, caption, alignment (left / center / right
  / none) and player behaviour - controls, autoplay, loop and preload
  (none / metadata / auto). A native `<audio>` player renders inline in the editor
  so authors can test playback before saving.

  The block serialises to a stable JSON shape (`type: "audio"`, `file`, `title`,
  `caption`, `player`, `alignment`) that frontend renderers turn into an HTML5
  `<audio>` element - see issue [#43](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/43) for the React and Astro renderer contract.

  The playground now seeds a short sample audio file so the showcase article ships
  with a working example.

## 0.16.1

### Patch Changes

- [#66](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/66) [`77b96b3`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/77b96b33b958cd605d3a366ec6b95c5aaf37c9d3) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - fix: consistent, always-visible scrollbar on toolbar dropdowns

  The toolbar's block-type ("Text"), font-size and font-family pickers were built
  on the design-system `SingleSelect`, which wraps its options in a Radix
  ScrollArea. That produced an inconsistent, sometimes doubled scrollbar compared
  to the `Menu`-based dropdowns (insert "+", alignment, line height).

  These three pickers are now built on the same `Menu` component as the other
  dropdowns, so every toolbar menu shares one scroll container and renders a
  single, always-visible, theme-aware scrollbar that makes it clear the list can
  be scrolled up and down.

  Adds a dedicated **Social embed** block to the editor. Authors pick a platform and
  paste a post URL; the plugin fetches the post's official embed server-side via a
  new oEmbed proxy (`GET /better-blocks/oembed`) so no platform tokens ever reach
  the browser. Responses are cached (configurable TTL). Supports per-embed caption,
  alignment, and a manual embed-code override.

  Configure enabled platforms and the Instagram/Facebook access tokens under
  `config.social` in `config/plugins.{js,ts}`.

  Code blocks in the editor now render with Shiki syntax highlighting that follows
  the admin's light/dark theme. The language selector is no longer hidden - it is
  an always-visible, colored pill in the top-right corner of the block - and the
  code block has a distinct background so it stands out from surrounding text.
  Grammars load on demand; `plaintext` renders without highlighting.

  Adds a `filePreview` option to file-download buttons. When enabled the file
  opens in a new tab (preview); when disabled it downloads directly. Exposed as a
  "Preview file instead of downloading" checkbox in the button editor and stored as
  `filePreview` on the block, so the frontend renderers can map it to
  `target="_blank"` vs `download`. Closes [#57](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/57).

  Adds a **Style preset** picker to the Button editor so authors can apply on-brand
  variants (Primary / Secondary / Outline / Filled) in one click. Editing any color
  or the border switches the selection to **Custom**. Presets are configurable per
  project via `config/plugins` (`better-blocks.button.presets`); the selected preset
  is stored as `style.variant`. Closes [#54](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/issues/54).

  Adds a new **Button** block (insert from the blocks selector, the `+` menu, or by typing `[button]`). Two modes:
  - **Link** - URL, open-in-new-tab (auto `rel="noopener noreferrer"`), ARIA label.
  - **File** - pick any Media Library asset to render a download button with optional file size and type icon.

  A full-screen editor with live preview controls alignment, background/text colors (incl. hover), border radius, font size/weight, padding presets, a structured border (toggle + thickness + style + color), and a custom CSS class. Admins can set default button colors via `config/plugins` or per field. Stored as `{ "type": "button", "buttonType": "link" | "file", "label": "…", … }`.

  Adds a native collapsible `details` block to the editor. Insert it from the blocks selector or the `/details` slash command. Each block has a plain-text `summary` label, a `defaultOpen` toggle (maps to the HTML `open` attribute), and full rich-text block content as children (paragraphs, lists, tables, images, and even nested details). The editor preview renders a bordered/GitHub-style header with a disclosure triangle and animated expand/collapse.

  Admins can set the default summary text and choose between a GitHub-minimal or bordered style - globally via `config/plugins.js` (`config.details.defaultSummary` / `config.details.style`), or per field in the Content-Type Builder (per-field overrides the global config).

  JSON output:

  ```json
  { "type": "details", "summary": "Click to expand", "defaultOpen": false, "children": [ ... ] }

  The previous anchored popover overflowed with long sources and was dismissed on page scroll, discarding unsaved edits. Both editors now open in a shared, near full-screen modal with a side-by-side source editor and live preview that fill the available height. The diagram/math preview can be zoomed in/out (with a reset) and is centered, so diagrams are no longer rendered too small to read, and the larger LaTeX preview keeps integrals and fractions legible.

- [#39](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/39) [`9608b68`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/9608b684a35f14895147221bf5e5d783480d35eb) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Add GitHub-style callout / admonition blocks. A new `callout` block holds
  nested rich-text content (`{ type: 'callout', variant, title?, children }`) in
  five variants - note, tip, important, warning, and caution - with an optional
  custom title. Insert it from the blocks selector or the `/note`, `/tip`,
  `/important`, `/warning`, `/caution` slash commands, and switch variant, edit
  the title, or dissolve the callout from the header popover. Variant colors use
  Strapi's design tokens so they adapt to light and dark mode.

## 0.8.0

### Minor Changes

- [#37](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/37) [`e54d8cc`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/e54d8cc1b84432fad0666686bc456b1e3c6a783d) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Add block-level Mermaid diagram support. A new `diagram` block stores the raw
  Mermaid definition (`{ type: 'diagram', format: 'mermaid', value }`) and renders
  it to SVG with a live preview. Insert it from the blocks selector, the
  `/mermaid` slash command, or by typing ` ```mermaid ` followed by a space. The
  diagram theme follows Strapi's light/dark mode and Mermaid is loaded lazily so
  it stays out of the main admin bundle.

### Minor Changes

- [#30](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/30) [`e689581`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/e68958134e30614501da8d544936f947e1cb7cae) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Add inline and block math (LaTeX / KaTeX) to the editor. Math is stored as a void `math` node (`{ type: 'math', format: 'inline' | 'block', value }`) and rendered with KaTeX in the editor preview. Insert block math from the blocks selector, the `/math` slash command, or by typing `$$ `; insert inline math from the toolbar Σ button or by typing `$…$ `. Clicking a formula opens a popover with a LaTeX input and live preview.

## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#26](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/pull/26) [`fc9ed7d`](https://github.com/k11k-labs/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/commit/fc9ed7df36c2f0d9393a20d58683a30b65d98103) Thanks [@kkukielka](https://github.com/kkukielka)! - Fix image caption editing (native `beforeinput`/`input`/`keydown` events now stopPropagation past Slate's Editable, so typing, backspace and enter work inside the caption). Fix emoji picker search (filter now matches against per-emoji keywords instead of always returning true). Add per-feature demo GIFs to documentation.
