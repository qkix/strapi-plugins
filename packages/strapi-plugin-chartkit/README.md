```

Add a **Chart** field to a content type. That's it - no config file, no provider.

## Why server-side SVG

Most chart plugins hand the browser a charting library and some JSON, and let it
draw. That means shipping and executing a charting runtime on every page that
has a chart, and leaving a hole in the layout until it runs.

Chartkit renders the SVG **when the page is built or requested**. The browser
receives finished markup:

- **No runtime.** Nothing to download, parse, or execute.
- **Nothing to hydrate**, so no layout shift and no flash of empty box.
- **It scales and prints** - it is vector, not a canvas bitmap.
- **Screen readers get a real description**: `role="img"` with a `<title>` and
  the description you wrote.

## Every chart type

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-chartkit/docs/chart-types.png" alt="Bar, grouped, stacked, line, area, pie, donut, gaps and negative values" width="900" />

Bar, grouped and stacked bars, line, area and stacked area, pie and donut.

Two of those tiles are the details that usually go wrong. A missing reading
stays a **gap** - never a zero pretending to be a measurement. And negative
values get a real baseline instead of being flipped or clipped.

## Editing

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-chartkit/docs/editor.png" alt="The chart editor: live preview, chart settings and a data grid" width="700" />

A live preview above a spreadsheet-style grid. **The preview is the real
renderer** - the same function that draws the published page - so a chart cannot
look right here and wrong there.

The editor opens in a dialog. Cancel genuinely cancels: it edits a draft and
only writes on save.

### Labels are dates

Turn this on and the labels stop being names and become instants: readings are
placed by _when_ they are, so a day's gap and a fortnight's gap no longer look
alike. Ticks then come from the calendar rather than from your rows, which is
what lets a year of daily figures label itself with a few months instead of 365
smeared dates.

Labels have to be dates for it - ISO 8601, e.g. `2026-08-20`. One that is not is
named in the editor rather than quietly drawn as a category again.

Off by default, including for labels that look like dates: `2024` and `2025` may
be two categories you meant to weigh equally, and re-spacing them because they
parse would be a decision this plugin has no business making for you.

## Three ways to get the numbers in

Most charts already exist as numbers somewhere, and retyping them is the worst
part of every charting tool.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-chartkit/docs/paste.png" alt="Pasting a semicolon-separated spreadsheet, with the parse summary shown before anything is replaced" width="700" />

**Paste from a spreadsheet.** Copy a range out of Sheets or Excel and paste it.

| Input                     | Read as                               |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| tab, comma or semicolon   | detected per paste                    |
| `1.234,50` and `1,234.50` | 1234.5 either way                     |
| `€1 234,50`               | 1234.5 - currency and spaces stripped |
| `"North, inland"`         | one cell; a quoted delimiter survives |
| `n/a`, `-`, empty         | a **gap**, never a zero               |

It shows **what it parsed before replacing anything** - above, four categories,
two series, and one unreadable cell called out. The parser has to guess whether
the first row is a header, and a wrong guess that silently overwrites your data
is far worse than one you can cancel.

**From the Media Library.** Pick a `.csv`, `.tsv` or `.txt` you already
uploaded. Anything else is refused before it is fetched - handing a PDF to a CSV
parser produces a confident table of nonsense.

**By hand**, in the grid.

## Rendering it

The field stores a `ChartSpec` - the same object the renderers take. Nothing
sits in between:

```tsx
import { Chart } from '@qkix/chartkit-react-renderer';

<Chart spec={article.chart} locale="en-US" />;
```

```astro
---
import { Chart } from '@qkix/chartkit-astro-renderer';
---

<Chart spec={article.chart} locale="en-US" />
```

```vue
<script setup>
import { Chart } from '@qkix/chartkit-vue-renderer';
</script>

<template>
  <Chart :spec="article.chart" locale="en-US" />
</template>
```

They all produce markup at build or request time. None ships a runtime.

## It takes your theme, including dark mode

The chart carries no colors of its own. Series are drawn as
`fill="var(--chart-series-N, currentColor)"` and text inherits the page font, so
a chart looks like it belongs wherever it lands:

```css
:root {
  --chart-series-1: #4945ff;
  --chart-series-2: #f0a500;
  --chart-axis: #8e8ea9;
  --chart-text: #32324a;
  --chart-grid: #eaeaef;
}

[data-theme='dark'] {
  --chart-text: #ffffff;
  --chart-grid: #32324a;
}
```

This is the reason the SVG is hand-written rather than produced by an existing
SSR chart renderer. The obvious candidate, ECharts in SSR mode, writes its
palette into the markup as literal hex values - which makes class-based dark
mode impossible without post-processing the output.

### When one chart needs to say something else

Under **Colors** in the editor there is a swatch per series - per slice, on a pie
or donut. Leave one alone and it keeps following your stylesheet; set one and
that series overrules it, which is what picking out a single line or reddening
the quarter that went wrong requires.

Only the entries you set are stored, so highlighting one series does not freeze
the colors of the others against your next restyle. The cross beside a swatch
hands that series back to the site.

A color set here beats the CSS on purpose. The stylesheet is the house style; a
chart that names a color is overruling it for a reason, and a house style that
could silently repaint it would be no override at all.

## Also a block, if you use Better Blocks

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-chartkit/docs/block.png" alt="A chart block inside a Better Blocks rich-text document" width="700" />

Charts can live inside a rich-text document instead of, or as well as, in a
field of their own. With
[Better Blocks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qkix/strapi-plugin-better-blocks)
installed, that is one line in `src/admin/app.tsx`:

```ts
import { registerBlock } from '@qkix/strapi-plugin-better-blocks/strapi-admin';
import { chartBlockDefinition } from '@qkix/chartkit-editor/block';

export default {
  register() {
    registerBlock(chartBlockDefinition({ locale: 'en-US' }));
  },
};
```

The front end needs its own half - `chartBlockPlugin` from whichever renderer
you use - or a chart authored in a document is stored correctly and drawn as
nothing.

## Field options

| Option                       | Effect                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Number formatting locale** | How axis numbers are formatted **in the admin preview** - a BCP 47 tag such as `de-DE`. The front end passes its own at render. |
| **Required**                 | Standard Strapi validation.                                                                                                     |

## Old charts stay working

The spec is versioned, and the field **migrates on read**, so opening a chart
saved against an older schema edits and saves the current shape. Nothing has to
be resaved for a site to keep working: `renderChart` migrates in memory too.

If a field holds something that is not a readable chart - a value from an import
script, or a field that used to be a different type - it says so and goes
**read-only** rather than offering to overwrite it.

## Not there yet

Being honest about the edges: no tooltips or other interactivity. Data is stored
with the chart rather than queried from a collection, so a chart of something
that changes is a chart somebody has to remember to update.
