# Chartkit roadmap

What would make Chartkit better, in rough order of how much it would help.
Nothing here is a promise or a date. It is a public list so that anyone opening
an issue can see whether the thing they want is already understood, already
decided against, or genuinely new.

Ideas and disagreement welcome at
[qkix/strapi-plugins/issues](https://github.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/issues).

## Next

### Numbers from a collection rather than stored with the chart

Data lives with the chart, so a chart of something that changes is a chart
somebody has to remember to update. Pointing a chart at a content type and a
field would make it current by construction.

It is the largest thing on this list, because it moves Chartkit from rendering
into querying: filters, aggregation, permissions on the underlying data, and an
answer for what a chart does when the query returns nothing. Worth doing in that
order rather than in one go.

## Later

### Optional tooltips

There is no interactivity, which is what makes a chart cost zero client-side
JavaScript. That premise is worth keeping as the default. An opt-in layer that
hydrates only the charts that asked for it would let a dashboard have hover
values without imposing a runtime on a blog post that just wanted a bar chart.

### More chart types

Driven by what people actually ask for rather than by completeness. Filling out
a matrix of chart types nobody requested is how a charting library becomes large
and hard to change.

## Considered, and not planned

### Shipping a client-side charting library

The entire point is that a page gets a chart without a byte of client-side
JavaScript, and server-rendered SVG is what makes that true. Adding a runtime
renderer would make Chartkit a worse version of the libraries that already exist.

### An editor for arbitrary SVG or custom D3

Chartkit stores a spec and renders it. Accepting drawing code instead would mean
executing whatever an editor typed, on the server, at render time.
