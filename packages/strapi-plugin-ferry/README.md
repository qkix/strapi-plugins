## Why another one of these

Import and export is the most-wanted thing in the Strapi ecosystem that nobody
maintains. The original plugin was last published in December 2023 and requires
Strapi 4, so it does not run at all on Strapi 5. The Strapi 5 fork of it was
written over two days in October 2024, released as `0.0.1`, and never touched
again. Between them they still take around 780 downloads a day, and the fork has
24 forks of its own, which is what "I had to patch it myself" looks like from the
outside.

Its open issues say what is broken, and the two that matter are not details:

- **relations do not import**, because the code carries Strapi 4's numeric `id`
  and a numeric id means a different row in every environment
- **components do not export**, because `populate: '*'` stops one level down and
  a component inside a component comes back empty

Ferry is built around those two, and around the thing neither plugin has: it
tells you what it is going to do before it does it.

## Install

```sh
npm install @qkix/strapi-plugin-ferry
```

```ts
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
  ferry: {
    enabled: true,
  },
};
```

Then open **Ferry** in the main menu.

## Exporting from the list view

Ferry's own page carries whole content types. The Content Manager is where you
usually know which entries you actually want, so the export is there too, in the
two shapes that question comes in:

- **Tick some rows** and _Export_ appears beside _Delete_. This is the "a copy of
  the twelve articles I just fixed" case.
- **Narrow the list with filters** and the _Export_ button next to the view
  settings takes everything that matches - including what is on the pages you
  cannot see, which is why ticking rows cannot answer it.

Either way you pick the format and the version, and the file downloads. Both
respect the `plugin::ferry.export` permission and appear only on the project's
own content types, so nothing offers an export the server would refuse.

## The dry run

Nothing is written until you have read a report. Upload a file, and Ferry
resolves the whole thing against the database first:

- how many documents it will **create**, **update** and **skip**
- every relation that points at a document which is **neither in the file nor in
  this environment**, named by row and by field, including
  `seo.owner`-style paths inside a component
- which columns of a CSV it did not recognise, which media it could not find,
  which fields the format cannot carry

Then you press the button. It is the same request either way with one flag
changed, so the preview cannot drift from what the import does.

## Relations that arrive

Ferry keys everything on **`documentId`**, which is the one identifier that means
the same thing in your laptop's database and in production. That is what makes an
import an upsert rather than a paste: run the same file twice and the second run
updates in place instead of duplicating the content.

The import runs in **two passes** - every document is written first, and the
links between them second. There is no ordering of a single pass that works,
because two documents that refer to each other cannot both be written second. A
missing target is reported rather than discovered: Strapi refuses an entire row
when one relation points at nothing, so an importer that just tries it loses
content it never mentioned.

An import is **all or nothing** by default. If a row fails, the whole thing rolls
back and the database is exactly as it was, because a half-applied import is
worse than a refused one - nobody knows which half. You can opt into committing
the rest.

## Components, dynamic zones and media

Components are exported and imported whole, including **a component inside a
component**, and including **a relation inside a component**. Component ids are
dropped, because a component row belongs to one document and its id means nothing
in another database. A dynamic zone keeps its order, because in a dynamic zone
the order is the content.

Media travels as a **reference, not as bytes**. Ferry matches by the file's
`hash`, which is derived from its contents, so the same image already uploaded to
the target environment is reconnected even though its id and filename differ.
When it is not there, the field is left empty and the report says how many.

## A file you can commit

An export has **no timestamp in it**, and documents come out sorted by
`documentId` with a to-many relation sorted too. Two exports of the same content
are byte-for-byte identical, so the file can live in a repository and a diff
means something changed. Git already knows when the file arrived.

```json
{
  "ferry": 1,
  "contentType": "api::article.article",
  "status": "draft",
  "count": 1,
  "documents": [
    {
      "documentId": "k2n4xk1t9m0q8v7w",
      "title": "The first one",
      "author": "a91xbq2r7t4m0p3z",
      "tags": ["c7h2k9m1p4r8t0w3", "d1f5j8n2q6s9v3y7"],
      "seo": {
        "metaTitle": "Meta title",
        "canonical": { "href": "https://example.com/one", "label": "Canonical" }
      },
      "blocks": [
        { "__component": "shared.quote", "body": "A quote" },
        { "__component": "shared.seo", "metaTitle": "Inside a zone" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## CSV

CSV is a real implementation of RFC 4180, not a split on commas: a comma inside a
title, a quote inside a body, a line break inside a paragraph all survive the
round trip. It reads a **semicolon** file, which is what a spreadsheet saves in
every locale that uses a comma for decimals, and writes a byte order mark so
Excel opens UTF-8 as UTF-8.

CSV carries flat fields and relation keys. Components and dynamic zones are left
out, and the export says which ones by name rather than writing a JSON blob into
a spreadsheet cell that no one can edit. Use JSON when you want everything.

One rule worth knowing: **a blank cell means "leave this alone"**, not "empty
this field". CSV cannot tell the two apart, and the safe reading is the one that
does not let a spreadsheet quietly erase content that simply was not in it.

## Permissions

Two, under **Settings → Administration panel → Roles**:

| Permission     | What it allows                                    |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `ferry.export` | reading content out, and seeing the list of types |
| `ferry.import` | the dry run and the import itself                 |

They are separate because they are different risks. An export is a copy; an
import replaces what is there. A role that may take a copy away has no automatic
claim on replacing production.

## From a script

Both directions are plain admin endpoints, so anything with an admin session can
drive them - a CI job, a seeding script, a migration between environments:

```sh
# Take a copy
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/ferry/export \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"uid":"api::article.article","format":"json"}' \
  -o articles.json

# See what importing it would do, without doing it
curl -X POST http://localhost:1337/ferry/import/preview \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -F uid=api::article.article \
  -F file=@articles.json
```

The import endpoints take a multipart upload, which keeps a large file clear of
the JSON body limit, or a `content` field with the file inline for scripting
convenience.

`POST /ferry/export` returns the file itself, which is what you want piped into
`-o`. Pass `"envelope": true` to get it wrapped in JSON instead, as
`{ filename, mime, body, count, warnings }` - useful when you want the warnings
alongside the content rather than in the `X-Ferry-Warnings` header, and what the
admin panel itself uses.

| Route                   | Method | Does                                  |
| ----------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------- |
| `/ferry/content-types`  | GET    | what can be carried                   |
| `/ferry/plan/:uid`      | GET    | which fields travel, and which do not |
| `/ferry/export`         | POST   | the file                              |
| `/ferry/import/preview` | POST   | the dry run                           |
| `/ferry/import`         | POST   | the import                            |

## Configuration

| Option      | Default | What it does                                            |
| ----------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `exclude`   | `[]`    | Content types Ferry will not carry, in either direction |
| `maxExport` | `10000` | The most documents one export will read                 |

```ts
export default {
  ferry: {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      exclude: ['api::invoice.invoice'],
    },
  },
};
```

An excluded type is refused by the endpoints as well as hidden in the picker: a
hidden thing that can still be fetched by typing its uid is not hidden.

A `password` field is never exported, whatever the configuration says. A hash is
still a credential, and files get mailed around and committed.

## What it does not do

Said plainly, because finding out later is worse:

- **It does not carry files.** Media travels as a reference and is reconnected by
  hash when the upload already exists in the target.
- **One content type per file.** Export the types a relation points at first, and
  import them in that order. Links within a single file work in any order.
- **One locale per file.** Pass `locale` to move a specific one.
- **No XLSX.** CSV opens in the same places.

## Tested against a real Strapi

The test suite boots an actual Strapi against a throwaway database rather than
mocking one, and the headline test is the thing people actually do: export a
whole environment, delete its content, import the files back, and assert that a
second export is **byte-for-byte the first**.

Nine of the tests are about Strapi rather than about Ferry. They pin down the
behaviour the design rests on, so that a Strapi upgrade that changes it fails a
test here instead of quietly corrupting an import - that `documentId` can be
assigned on create, that `create` is not an upsert, that a missing relation
target takes the whole row down, and that a draft is allowed to be incomplete so
`required` is no guide to what will import.
