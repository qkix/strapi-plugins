</p>

A document moves through stages - _Draft_, _In review_, _Approved_ - each with a reviewer
and its own rules about who may move it where. Until it reaches the approved stage, **it
cannot be published** - note the greyed-out Publish button above, which names the stage
that is holding it.

## What this is, and what it is not

Strapi sells a feature called **Review Workflows** on its Enterprise plan. Greenlight is
not that feature, is not a drop-in replacement for it, and does not share a line of code
with it - it is written against the public documentation only.

The difference that matters is not the price. In Strapi's implementation a stage is a
**label**, not a gate: an editor can open a document sitting in "In progress" and hit
Publish, and nothing stops them. The stage records an opinion about the document; it does
not govern it.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/refused.png" alt="Publishing an unapproved document is refused, with a message naming the document, its stage and its reviewer" width="900" />
</p>

Greenlight's stages govern it. A document outside its approved stage is refused at publish
time by a check on the server, whichever route the publish came in by - the edit view, the
list view's bulk action, the REST admin API, or your own code calling the Document
Service. That refusal is the product. Everything else here exists to make it usable.

It is also unmetered on purpose: Strapi's plan limits how many workflows and stages you
get. Greenlight limits neither.

## Install

```sh
npm install @qkix/strapi-plugin-greenlight
```

```ts
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
  greenlight: {
    enabled: true,
  },
};
```

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/settings.png" alt="The settings page: a workflow, the content types it covers, and its stages with a role list on each side" width="900" />
</p>

Then open **Settings → Greenlight → Review workflows**, create a workflow, and tick the
content types it covers. Which content types are under review is **not** configured in
code - it lives on the workflow, in the database, so a content type can be put under
review without a deploy.

Only content types with **Draft & Publish** can be added. Without it there is no publish
action to refuse, so a gate would be decorative; the settings page filters them out and
the API rejects them with an explanation rather than failing later.

Collection types and single types are both supported, with the same panel, gate and queue.

## How a document moves

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/panel.png" alt="The review panel: current stage, the stages this role may move to, a comment, the reviewer, and the history of every move" width="320" />
</p>

Each stage carries two role lists: who may move a document **out** of it, and who may move
a document **in**. The stages offered in the panel are the intersection of both.

Both lists matter. Without the "out" side there is no way to stop someone dragging a
document back out of the approved stage, approving it again and publishing - and then the
gate is theatre.

> **An empty role list means _anyone with access to the plugin_, not nobody.** Intuition
> says the opposite. A stage configured with no roles is unrestricted, not a dead end.

A stage change saves immediately, with no separate Save button, matching the rest of that
column in the edit view. Every change is written to an append-only log with the stage
names and the user's name copied in, so the history stays readable after a stage is
renamed or an account is deleted.

Two reviewers with the same panel open cannot silently overwrite each other: each
transition carries the version the panel was rendered with, and the second one gets a 409
telling it to refresh.

## On the list view

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/list-view.png" alt="The Content Manager's list view with a Review stage column, showing one document in review and the rest greyed out in the first stage" width="900" />
</p>

Every collection covered by a workflow gets a **Review stage** column and a filter to go
with it, and no field is added to your content type to make either appear. A document that
has never been through the workflow is shown greyed out, in the stage the gate would treat
it as being in - so a collection that predates the plugin reads honestly rather than
blank.

The whole page is answered in one request. The column and the greyed-out Publish buttons
share it, so a page of rows asks once in total rather than once per row.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/list-filter.png" alt="The same list filtered to Review stage is Draft, returning nine of ten documents" width="900" />
</p>

Filtering by a stage finds the documents implied to be in it too, not only the ones put
there - which is why filtering by the first stage above returns nine of the ten, and not
just the one that was actually moved into it.

Three limits worth knowing. The column does not **sort** - sorting happens inside the
Content Manager's own query, which cannot see this plugin's table. The filter offers only
**is** and **is not**; every other operator would either mean nothing for a stage or have
to be answered with a scan. And on the very first list view opened in a new browser
session, the column and filter can be missing until you navigate once: the hooks that add
them have to answer synchronously, and which content types are under review is a database
answer, cached per session.

The filter is answered by resolving the stage to a set of documents before the query runs,
which caps out: past **5,000** documents in one stage it returns an error naming the limit
rather than a quietly incomplete list. Narrow the list with another filter first, or use
**My reviews**.

## Permissions

Three plugin permissions, set per role in **Settings → Administration panel → Roles**:

| Permission           | What it allows                                  |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `read`               | See the queue and move documents between stages |
| `settings.configure` | Create and edit workflows and stages            |
| `assign`             | Set the reviewer on a document                  |

These are the coarse switch. The rules about which _stage_ a role may move a document into
live on the stages themselves and are checked on the server, on the route - the panel
hiding an option you cannot use is a convenience, not the enforcement.

**`superAdmin` bypasses the per-stage role checks, and does _not_ bypass the publish
gate.** Deliberately: if it bypassed the gate the feature would be switched off for the
account most people develop and operate with.

## System operations

Seeds, imports and migrations publish on purpose and have no reviewer to answer to. They
pass a flag:

```ts
await strapi.documents('api::article.article').publish({
  documentId,
  locale: 'en',
  greenlight: { bypass: true },
});
```

The key is stripped before the call reaches Strapi's own parameter handling. To be plain
about what this is: anyone who can run server-side code can bypass the gate. Greenlight
controls a process, it does not defend against your own developers.

## Configuration

| Option                    | Default | What it does                                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hooks.onTransition`      | `null`  | Called after a stage change with the transition just recorded. The notification hook. |
| `transitionRetentionDays` | `365`   | How long the transition log is kept.                                                  |

Greenlight does not send email. `onTransition` is where you do, and an error thrown inside
it is logged and swallowed - a notification outage must not be able to undo a review
decision that has already been written.

## Known limitations

**The stage filter is resolved before the query, not inside it.** The Content Manager
validates every filter against your content type's schema and rejects whatever is not an
attribute on it, so a stage - which lives in this plugin's own table, not in your schema -
cannot be filtered directly. Greenlight answers the stage question first and hands the
Content Manager a `documentId` filter instead. That is why the 5,000-document limit above
exists, and why the filter cannot be combined with a sort on the stage.

<p align="center">
  <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-greenlight/docs/queue.png" alt="My reviews: every document waiting on a decision, across content types, filtered by reviewer and stage" width="900" />
</p>

**Bulk publish fails as a batch, and the error names one document.** If any selected entry
has not been approved, Strapi's bulk publish rolls the whole batch back and reports the
first refusal. There is no warning beforehand: the Content Manager declares a
`publishModalAdditionalInfos` injection zone that would have been the right place for one,
but nothing renders it in Strapi 5.52, so the feature cannot be built today. The per-row
Publish action is disabled for unapproved entries, which is the closest available warning.

(Precisely how much of a batch survives a refusal is a race inside Strapi's transaction
bookkeeping, so Greenlight's error message deliberately makes no claim about the other
documents - no claim would be safe.)

**Documents that predate the plugin have no stage.** By default they are put in the first
stage and blocked, which is the honest behaviour: the alternative is that installing the
plugin changes nothing for existing content and somebody discovers that in production. Set
`onMissingAssignment: 'allow'` on the workflow to let them through instead.

## Working alongside other plugins

Greenlight registers its publish gate in `register()` rather than `bootstrap()`, so it runs
outside plugins that snapshot documents - [Rewind](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@qkix/strapi-plugin-rewind), for one. A
publish that is refused never reaches them, and no version is recorded for something that
did not happen.

If your licence has Strapi's own Review Workflows enabled, Greenlight logs a warning at
boot: both will show a panel in the edit view, and you probably want only one of them.
