 * rules here: `onMissingAssignment` alone means a document with no stage at all
 * can be perfectly publishable, and any second implementation of that gets it
 * wrong eventually. See `gate.publishable`.
 *
 * Requests are batched and cached in `reviewBatch` - shared with the list
 * view's stage column, so a page of rows asks once in total rather than once
 * per row per feature.
