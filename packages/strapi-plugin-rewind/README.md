</p>

The panel sits in the edit view, next to the document it belongs to. Each entry
is a point you can go back to: what the document said, when, and who saved it.

## What this is, and what it is not

Strapi sells a feature called **Content History** on its Growth and Enterprise
plans. Rewind is **not that feature**, is not a drop-in replacement for it, and
does not unlock it.

It is the poor cousin. If you pay for Growth, use Strapi's - it is deeper, it is
supported by the people who wrote the CMS, and it will stay in step with Strapi
in a way a third-party plugin cannot promise. Rewind exists for everyone on
Community Edition, who today has nothing at all: no way to see what a document
said last Tuesday, and no way to get it back after someone pastes over it.

A few things it does that the paid feature does not, mostly because they were
cheap to add once the plumbing existed:

- **Restoring keeps fields that were added after the version was taken.**
  Strapi's restore sets them to `null`, which quietly loses whatever was in
  them.
- **Discarding a draft is recorded before the draft is gone**, so the work you
  threw away is still recoverable. A snapshot taken afterwards can only ever
  contain the published copy you already had.
- **A save that changed nothing does not create a version.** Strapi writes a row
  either way.
- **The schema snapshot descends into nested components.** Strapi's stops one
  level down and carries an open TODO about it.
- **Writes from outside the Content Manager can be versioned** (opt-in), where
  Strapi only ever records admin-panel edits.

And a good deal it does _not_ do - see [Limits](#limits).

### On not touching the paywall

Rewind never reads or writes `strapi.ee`, never inspects a licence, and never
enables a gated feature. It is an independent implementation writing to its own
table, and it works the same whether or not you have a Strapi licence. Strapi's
history code is MIT-licensed and was read while working out what the problem
actually is - the way you would read any open-source implementation before
writing your own - but the code here is written for this plugin.

## Install

```bash
npm install @qkix/strapi-plugin-rewind
```

```ts
// config/plugins.ts
export default {
  rewind: {
    enabled: true,
    config: {
      // Nothing is tracked until you say so.
      contentTypes: ['api::article.article'],
    },
  },
};
```

That empty default is deliberate. A plugin that starts writing a database row on
every save the moment it is installed is a plugin that gets uninstalled after
the first disk alert.

## What gets recorded

Six actions on a tracked content type: `create`, `update`, `clone`, `publish`,
`unpublish` and `discardDraft`. Each version stores the document's content, its
relations, and a snapshot of the schema at the time - the last of which is what
lets a restore tell "this field was empty" apart from "this field did not exist
yet".

A relation is stored as what it pointed at _and_ what that was called, using the
field the Content Manager titles the entry by. Storing the name is what makes a
history readable once the target is gone: the id of a deleted author resolves to
nothing, and "Ada Lovelace no longer exists and will be left out" is the sentence
an editor needs.

Publishing records **one** version, not two, even though the Content Manager
saves the draft and publishes it as two separate operations.

A save that is rolled back records nothing.

The badge says what happened to the document. **Replaced by restore** marks the
state a restore was about to overwrite - the undo point for that restore.

## Restoring

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-rewind/docs/restore.png" alt="The restore confirmation dialog" width="400" />

Restore writes to the **draft only**. The document moves to _Modified_, and
publishing stays something a person decides to do.

Before anything is written, the state being replaced is itself recorded, so a
restore can always be undone.

The panel shows a preview before asking you to confirm, because the interesting
part of a restore is what it will _not_ do:

- fields not present in that version keep their current values
- fields no longer in the model are skipped
- links to documents or media that have since been deleted are dropped, and
  reported
- **fields that are not translated per locale change in every locale at once** -
  restoring the Polish version of a document rewrites a shared field for every
  other language too. This is not a choice the plugin makes; a non-localised
  field physically has one value. The dialog names those fields and counts the
  locales before you commit.

## Seeing what changed

Every entry in the panel has a **What changed** link, comparing that version
with the one saved immediately before it.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-rewind/docs/changes.png" alt="The What changed dialog: a Compare with dropdown above a word-level diff, with 'put back' struck through and replaced by 'restored in one click'" width="760" />

Scalars are shown as a plain before and after. Prose - including rich text
stored as JSON - is compared word by word, with the unchanged stretches
collapsed, so a one-word edit in a long article reads as one word rather than
as the whole article with something green in it somewhere. Relations are
reported as linked and unlinked, by name where the version has one.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qkix/strapi-plugins/main/packages/strapi-plugin-rewind/docs/relations.png" alt="The What changed dialog showing the featured relation: plus Plugin showcase in green, minus Autumn release notes in red" width="760" />

The name comes from the version, not from the target, so it still reads this way
once the target has been deleted.

Where a field's stored value changed but its readable text did not - a mark
applied, blocks reordered - it says so, rather than showing an empty diff.

### Comparing any two versions

"What did this save do" is the question the default answers, and it is the one
asked most. The other one - "what has changed since Friday" - needs both ends,
so the dialog carries a **Compare with** dropdown listing the other versions of
that document. Pick one and the diff redraws against it.

The comparison always reads oldest to newest, whichever end you picked first, so
choosing the earlier version second does not turn every addition into a removal.
The dropdown offers the versions loaded in the panel; **Show older versions**
reaches further back and they appear there too.

### Rendering a field type properly

Pulling the words out of a rich-text field tells an editor _that_ a paragraph
changed, and nothing about a block moving or an image being swapped. Only the
package that owns the format can show that, so the mapping is a registry:

```ts
import { registerDiffRenderer } from '@qkix/strapi-plugin-rewind/strapi-admin';

import { MyBlocksDiff } from './MyBlocksDiff'; // yours - see below

registerDiffRenderer('plugin::better-blocks.better-blocks', MyBlocksDiff);
```

Keyed by a custom field's uid, or by an attribute `type`. A uid wins over a
type, since every custom field stores itself as `json`.

> **Bring your own renderer.** Rewind ships the registry, not the renderers. No
> `@qkix` package currently exports a block-aware diff component - including
> Better Blocks - so the component above is one you write. A renderer receives
> the two values and returns the `FieldChange` shape exported alongside
> `registerDiffRenderer`; without one registered, a field falls back to the
> generic text diff. A ready-made renderer for Better Blocks documents is
> wanted, and not yet written.

## Pinning a version

Every entry has a pin. A pinned version is never thinned, whatever the retention
settings say and however old it gets - the state the site launched in, the draft
before a rewrite, the version somebody will ask about in a year.

Pinning is the one thing in this panel that writes to the history rather than to
the document, and it is the whole of it: a version is pinned or it is not.
Nothing else about the version changes, and unpinning hands it straight back to
the next prune.

## Configuration

| Option                     | Default       | Meaning                                                                                                         |
| -------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `contentTypes`             | `[]`          | Which content types to version. Empty means none.                                                               |
| `trackApiWrites`           | `false`       | Also version writes from outside the Content Manager (REST, GraphQL, programmatic). `userId` is null for those. |
| `retention.enabled`        | `true`        | Thin old versions on a schedule. `false` keeps everything forever and leaves the table to you.                  |
| `retention.keepAllDays`    | `7`           | Keep every version this many days back.                                                                         |
| `retention.dailyUntilDays` | `30`          | Then keep one a day, up to this age.                                                                            |
| `retention.maxAgeDays`     | `365`         | Then keep one a week, and drop anything older.                                                                  |
| `retention.keepAnchors`    | `true`        | Never thin publish, unpublish, discard or restore versions, whatever their age.                                 |
| `cron`                     | `'0 3 * * *'` | When the thinning runs, in the server's timezone.                                                               |

The three windows must widen in order - `keepAllDays <= dailyUntilDays <=
maxAgeDays` - and the plugin refuses to boot rather than delete on a guess if
they do not. Pinned versions are never thinned either, independently of
`keepAnchors`.

So out of the box a year of history costs roughly: every save for a week, one a
day for a month, one a week after that, plus every publish and every pin.

## Limits

Worth knowing before you install it, not after:

- **Polymorphic relations are skipped**, and reported as unsupported in the
  restore preview rather than silently mangled.
- **Only the Document Service is visible.** Writes made through
  `strapi.db.query()` or the legacy entity service bypass the middleware
  entirely and cannot be captured at any setting.
- **A relation's name is a snapshot too.** A version records what the target was
  called when it was taken, so a link survives the target being deleted. It does
  not follow a later rename: a version from March says what the author was called
  in March, which is the point.
- **Versions taken before names were recorded have none**, and fall back to
  counting - "2 linked items" - because a name cannot be recovered after the
  fact.
- **Media is referenced, never copied.** Delete the file and the version knows
  the file is gone; it cannot bring it back.

## Keeping your history when the plugin is off

Strapi's schema sync drops tables belonging to content types it no longer sees.
Disable this plugin for a single boot and the history would go with it - so on
boot Rewind adds its table to Strapi's `persisted_tables` list, which is the
same mechanism Strapi uses to protect its own. Nothing to configure.
