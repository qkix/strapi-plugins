 * Lets another package render the diff for its own field type.

 * Rewind compares a rich-text field by pulling the readable words out of the
 * JSON, which tells an editor *that* a paragraph changed but nothing about
 * blocks moving, an image being swapped, or a table gaining a row. The package
 * that owns the field format is the only one that can show that properly, so
 * the type-to-component mapping is a registry rather than a switch:
 *
 *   import { registerDiffRenderer } from '@qkix/strapi-plugin-rewind/strapi-admin';
 *   registerDiffRenderer('plugin::better-blocks.better-blocks', MyBlocksDiff);
 *
 * Keyed by the attribute's `type`, or by a custom field's uid.
 *
 * `MyBlocksDiff` above is the caller's own component. No @qkix package exports
 * one today - this is the hook for writing it, not a wiring instruction for
 * something that already exists. Without a renderer registered, the field falls
 * back to the generic text diff.
